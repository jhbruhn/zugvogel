# Every value below exists to make a specific assertion possible. Keep the
# reasons when you change them:
#
#   MAP_MODE=raster + a STYLE_URL for the OTHER mode — so a test can prove
#   /info ignores the wrong-mode URL while zv_web_headers still contributes its
#   origin to the CSP.
#
#   NOMINATIM_URL pointing at a CLOSED local port — no test may reach the real
#   Nominatim, and a refused connection is what makes "the input was rejected"
#   (400) distinguishable from "the input was accepted and the upstream then
#   failed" (502). Without that distinction a coordinate-validation test is
#   vacuous.
#
#   Two dummy OAuth2 providers — a generic OIDC one, which must be told to ask
#   for the groups scope because a group mapping is configured, and a social
#   one, which must NOT be (an unknown scope fails the whole authorization
#   request there). Nothing signs in through either; the credentials are fake.
