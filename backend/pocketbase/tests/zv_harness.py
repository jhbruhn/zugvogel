"""The shared half of a Zugvogel backend rule/hook suite.

Imported by an app's own `test_rules.py`, which owns every assertion; this owns
the plumbing and the sweep helpers.

Why a class and not module globals: federfall's suite kept BASE, the counters
and the token in module scope, which works for exactly one suite per process.
An app that wants a second file (crons, or a slow group) then either re-reads
the env in both or shares mutable state between them. One object per run makes
that a non-question.
