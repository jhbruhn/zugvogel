/// `(a, b, …).wait` for futures whose failure reaches the UI.
///
/// `dart:async`'s record `.wait` reports ANY failure as a [ParallelWaitError],
/// never as the error that actually occurred. Zugvogel's error mapping reads
/// the concrete type — `isNetworkError` and `loadErrorMessage` both test for a
/// `RepositoryException` — so a wrapped failure renders as a generic
/// "something went wrong" AND takes the content already on screen with it,
/// where `AsyncValueView` would otherwise keep it until the connection
/// returns. On a long list that costs the user their scroll position and their
/// filters, for a condition they can only wait out (federfall-s5mm).
///
/// `waitUnwrapped` waits exactly as `.wait` does — every future is observed, so
/// none of their errors is left unhandled — and then throws the FIRST failure
/// as itself.
///
/// Prefer it over awaiting the futures one at a time when the calls are real
/// round trips. Starting a second future and awaiting it *after* the first
/// leaves its failure unobserved for as long as the first is in flight, so if
/// the first throws, the second surfaces as an unhandled async error instead.
/// Awaiting in sequence is only free when the futures are already resolved or
/// share one cached dependency.
