/// script that runs in this origin — an XSS bug here would be a full account

/// SPA is hardened against script injection in the first place: it is a
/// CanvasKit/wasm-rendered app (no DOM text nodes to inject into), ships no
/// inline scripts, and the shared `zv_web_headers` hook serves a same-origin
/// `script-src 'self'` CSP with no `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval`.
///
/// That makes the CSP header security-critical to this decision, not just
/// defence-in-depth: **do not** run a Zugvogel app with the CSP turned off (or
/// behind a proxy that strips the header) without also reworking token
/// storage. If that invariant ever needs to be dropped, the two documented
/// alternatives are a short-TTL token with silent refresh, or in-memory
