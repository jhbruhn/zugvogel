/// Exactly one instance exists, above the router (`MaterialApp.builder`) rather
/// than one per screen. Connectivity is an app-wide fact, so it gets a single
/// place to be stated: the strip never moves between screens, never repeats
/// itself on a screen that already failed to load, and it also covers routes
/// pushed outside the navigation shell — a multi-step wizard, admin, login —
/// which is where finding out late actually costs the user something.
///
/// Its counterpart is `AsyncValueView`, which keeps already-loaded data on
/// screen when a *refresh* fails on the network: this strip states the cause
/// once, so the content below it can stay readable instead of being replaced by
/// a full-screen error (federfall-gmnc).
///
/// Only a confirmed offline reading is shown. `onlineStatusProvider` already
/// de-flaps across two probes, so a strip that appears has staying power; the
/// provider's loading and error states render nothing, because not knowing is
/// not the same as being offline.
